      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My professional life began in the arts. I have had the immense privilege
        of traveling around the US and overseas as a professional actor.
        Eventually I realized I was ready to move on and do... something else.
        It didn't take me long to find my next passion: web development/software
        engineering have since become my nearest and dearest obsession. I
        graduated from Flatiron School's immersive bootcamp program on January
        29, 2021. <br></br>
