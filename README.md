# About This Project

This app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Thanks to [Keaton Sentak for the blog on contact form validation etc](https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/simple-react-contact-form-without-back-end-9fa06eff52d9) although the blog is a little outdated. For anything that breaks re. validation I highly recommend going to the react-hook-form docs which were incredibly helpful.

Thanks to [Josh-Gotro for the blog on setting up a Medium RSS feed on a React app](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-stream-a-medium-blog-to-your-react-js-portfolio-9d62de41916e)
