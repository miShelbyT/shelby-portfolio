# Portfolio Lovingly Created Using React and Material UI

Thanks to Keaton Sentak for the [blog](https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/simple-react-contact-form-without-back-end-9fa06eff52d9) on creating a contact form using react-form-hooks, Email JS etc although the blog is a little bit outdated. For anything that breaks re. validation I highly recommend going to the react-hook-form docs which were incredibly helpful.

BIG thanks to [Bitfumes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJE4LtAxLEw) for help with .env files and hiding API keys (shhhh).
